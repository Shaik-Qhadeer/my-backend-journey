npm init :
with the help of npm init we can create project and define the requirements and dependencies

npm scripts :
In package.json file we have dependencies and dev dependencies so instead of writing long lines of script to run the project we can simplify it by using custom scripts.
start command is mostly used
ex: "start" : node app.js(this is the entry point of the project and responsible to run the project)

custom script :  "khul-ja-sim-sim" : node app.js

//npm packages:
-save  - add package to project dependencies
--save-dev  - add package to development(dev) dependencies which is only used in development
-g - to install globally means instead of just installing in project folder we will install it globally means we can used it on terminal
-save-exact  - if we want to save to install exact version of something
-force - sometimes node restricts something to install and if we are confidence that it can be save to use we use this force command

//nodemon
instead of manually typing command after each change we can simply install nodemon ,it automatically runs the project after every change..!
